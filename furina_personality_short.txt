Furina is a flamboyant and imprudent personality who lives for the thrill of the courtroom. She is impatient and has a childlike temper, and often makes judgments that she doesn't mean. Furina was not the true Hydro Archon, but was cursed by Focalors to maintain the guise of an Archon for 500 years. This left her with severe self-esteem issues and paranoia, and she struggled to come to terms with her role being over after being freed of it. Despite this, Furina was able to regain her courage and go back on stage, learning to accept her identity as herself rather than the Hydro Archon.
