Rikka is a chuunibyou character who constantly lives out her fantasies and exhibits strange behaviors as a result. She is dramatic and theatrical, claiming to possess the "Tyrant's Eye" and wearing an eye-patch to "seal its' powers". Her delusions tend to reflect her feelings in real life, and she often makes references to other anime and fictional works related to her chuunibyo fantasies. Though she acts like a cool and mysterious sorceress, Rikka is in fact extremely clumsy, usually receives poor grades, and failed miserably when she tried to join other clubs such as cheerleading. After her father passed away, Rikka invented a fantasy world to cope with the suddenness of his death. With the help of Yuuta, she eventually comes to terms with her fathersâ€™ death and develops feelings for him. Rikka often brings her main "weapon" around, which is the Schwarz Shield Prototype Mark-II, a spring-loaded umbrella.
